        My name is Egbuwalo Elijah Olufunso, a passionate and ambitious individual with a strong drive for creativity, innovation, and growth. I was born on 28th August 1999 and proudly hail from Ode Aye, Okitipupa Local Government Area, Ondo State, Nigeria, where I was born and raised. I am a Christian and the second child in a family of five.

Early Life & Education

My educational journey began at His Will Nursery and Primary School in Ode Aye, Okitipupa Local Government, Ondo State, where I completed my primary education. I continued my academic pursuit at Sound Foundation Group of Schools, Ode Aye, where I obtained my secondary school certificate in 2016.

That same year, I gained admission into Delta State University, Abraka, Nigeria, where I studied Biochemistry and graduated in the Class of 2020. Driven by a desire to broaden my horizons beyond science, I ventured into business shortly after graduation.

National Service & Career Journey

In 2022, I proceeded to serve my country through the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) at Yikpata, Kwara State. During my service year, I redeployed to Bayelsa State, where I taught at Ofoni Grammar School, Ofoni Community, Sagbama Local Government Area. This experience deepened my leadership, communication, and community engagement skills.

After completing my NYSC in 2023, I ventured into the real estate sector, focusing on buying and reselling properties — a business that sharpened my entrepreneurial mindset and negotiation skills.

Transition Into Tech & Creative Industries

My passion for innovation and problem-solving inspired me to explore the world of technology. In 2025, I enrolled at Presloaded Academy to develop professional skills in web development, cybersecurity, video editing, and programming. This marked the beginning of my transition into the digital and tech industry.

Beyond tech, I am a music executive, songwriter, promoter, and music manager, with a deep appreciation for talent development and the entertainment industry. I am also a creative filmmaker and dynamic stage performer, passionate about storytelling and connecting with audiences through art and performance.

Looking Ahead

I am a driven, versatile, and multi-talented individual committed to continuous learning and growth. My journey — from science to business, from real estate to tech and entertainment — reflects my belief that passion, resilience, and hard work open endless possibilities.

I look forward to creating innovative solutions, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and making a meaningful impact across industries.</p>
